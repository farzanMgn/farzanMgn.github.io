# About Me

<br><br>
**Hi, I’m Farzane — welcome to my page!**
I’m passionate about everything that makes a great product with hands-on experience in both design and management.
What gives me joy is diving into data and statistics to uncover meaningful insights that help improve products and user experiences.
I strive to play an impactful role in creating products that make life simpler.
Curious to see what I’ve worked on? Head over to the **Experiences section**.
