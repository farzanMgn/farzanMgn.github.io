              Zerynth is an IoT company that helps manufacturers and enterprises connect their industrial machines to the cloud.
              But there was a challenge: while their IoT kits were powerful, they consumed a lot of energy. 
              Each data transmission drained the battery, limiting how long devices could operate in the field and raising 
              costs for customers.
            </p>
            <p>
              At zerynth , I was a Data Scientist. I faced the challenge of working with massive streams of IoT data 
              coming from industrial devices. My role was to make sense of this raw data: cleaning it, analyzing it, 
              and uncovering hidden patterns that could guide smarter decisions.

              it’s not practical to access each one just to replace a drained battery.

          That’s where I came in. I developed models to identify and filter out low-value data, reducing unnecessary transmissions

          In 2020, there was only a single French-made CPM rehabilitation device (Kinetec 6080™) available in the entire city, 
          priced at $8,000 — far beyond the reach of most patients. 
          The Orthopaedic Research Centre began work on a project called <em><b>Orthopedic Biometrics</b></em>, an ambitious project to design a local, 
          robust alternative at just $600.
          </p>
          <p>
            I worked on this project as a Product Manager for the Lab of Computational Biomechanics and Orthopedics at the School of 
            Computer Science and Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, where I led the end-to-end design of the Android application

          In 2016, Telegram had become Iran’s <b>#1 communication platform</b>, with 40M active users;
        nearly half its global base at the time. When <b>iTele</b>, the <b>first</b> third-party iOS client with a suite of 
        enhanced features, launched, it quickly rose to the top of the charts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I joined the team a year later, collaborating with the Product Owner to ship features that kept 
          users engaged and ensured <b>iTele</b> stayed ahead of expectations.

        At its core, iTele’s business model was straightforward:
      </p>
      <p>
        <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
          <mstyle mathvariant="bold">
            <mi>Revenue</mi>
            <mo>=</mo>
            <mi>Number&nbsp;of&nbsp;Active&nbsp;Users</mi>
            <mo>×</mo>
            <mi>Price&nbsp;per&nbsp;User</mi>
          </mstyle>
        </math>
      </p>

      <p>
        Keeping the price per user fixed, we needed to increase <b>the number of active users to grow revenue</b>. 
        That goal shaped everything we did.
        But achieving it was not simple. We faced a constant challenge: balancing two priorities at once; delivering features quickly
        enough to keep users engaged, while also building the visibility needed to attract new users.
      </p>
      <p>
        To grow the user base, we pushed forward on two tracks in parallel:
        <ol class="clean-list">
          <li><b>Feature Development</b> – releasing popular features quickly, based on user feedback and emerging trends.</li>
          <li><b>Marketing & Visibility </b> – running campaigns and driving social buzz to make iTele widely recognized online..</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
         These two tracks reinforced each other in a loop:

        <h3>iTele Growth & Revenue Loop</h3>
        <p>
          Popular Features drove User Engagement, Engaged users attracted More Users,
          More users meant Higher Revenue, Higher revenue and visibility supported Marketing Campaigns, 
          which then created demand for even more Popular Features.
          This loop became the engine behind iTele’s growth.

        <p><strong>My role as a Product Development Assistant focused on connecting these two tracks:</strong></p>
        <p><b>Prioritizing and filtering features</b> that had the highest potential impact, guided by user feedback and market research.</p>
        <p><b>Supporting marketing campaigns</b> that engaged users and amplified product visibility.</p>

          <p>
            Both efforts worked in a loop: we applied changes, tested and released them, gathered user feedback, refined the product, 
            and re-engaged users through campaigns. This cycle repeated continuously, creating a feedback-driven pipeline 
            that built long-term trust and engagement.
